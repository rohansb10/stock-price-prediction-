# Stock Price Prediction using Deep Learning

This project aims to predict stock prices using deep learning techniques and various Python libraries such as YFinance, Keras, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Description

The stock market is a highly volatile and complex environment, making accurate price predictions a challenging task. In this project, we leverage the power of deep learning algorithms and historical stock data to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting future stock prices.

## Features

- Fetch historical stock data using the YFinance library
- Preprocess and clean the data using Pandas and NumPy
- Visualize the data using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Build and train deep learning models using Keras and TensorFlow
- Predict future stock prices based on the trained model
